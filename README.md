# SLAM Beginner Resources

To visit: https://jessemorris.github.io/slam-beginner-resources/

This is intended to be a collection of resources to help people get started learning about Robotic Perception and SLAM. These are some of the educational resources that I found useful when I was first starting. 

I would love this to grow and help more people in the community. If you find the links here useful (or not) please make an issue or PR so I can update the page!
